# HydrozoaNerveNet
Basic scripts for constructing and running the hydrozoan jellyfish nerve net models using brian2

# Use
simply running either BellSimulation2D or BellSimulation3D will construct and run a model of the hydrozoan nerve net using conductance-based neurons and Morris-Lecar muscles. The 2D simulation also provides code for the generation of figures and animation, while the 3D script outputs a csv file containing the muscle activity along a crosssection of the jellyfish bell which can be used for a 2D fluid simulation of the resulting swimming motion.
